    content: `Coffee’s story is a tale that crosses continents, cultures, and centuries — and Rwanda proudly stands at its heart today.  
    The legend begins in 9th-century Ethiopia, where a goat herder named Kaldi noticed his goats dancing after nibbling on bright red coffee cherries.  
    Curious, he tried them himself — and soon, the world’s love affair with coffee was born.  
    From Ethiopia, coffee traveled to Yemen, then across the Arabian Peninsula, where monks brewed “qahwa” to stay awake during long nights of study.  
    By the 16th century, coffeehouses spread across the Ottoman Empire, becoming meeting points for poets, merchants, and philosophers.  
    The Dutch carried coffee to Java, the French took it to the Caribbean, and by the 17th century, it had conquered Europe — even earning the Pope’s blessing after initial suspicion.  
    London’s ‘penny universities’ brewed not just coffee but ideas that shaped modern culture.  
    Today, here in Rwanda, coffee has found one of its most beautiful homes — from the misty hills of Nyamagabe to the fertile soils of Gakenke, where smallholder farmers cultivate some of the world’s finest Arabica beans.`,
    quote: `At Jambokawa, every cup connects you to centuries of coffee history — from Kaldi’s goats to Rwanda’s rolling hills.`,
    content2: `Coffee’s journey didn’t stop at discovery — it evolved through innovation and care.  
    Rwanda’s coffee renaissance began after the 1990s, when farmers shifted from bulk exports to specialty-grade micro-lots celebrated worldwide for their floral aroma, sweet citrus, and silky body.  
    Through programs like the Cup of Excellence, Rwandan farmers now compete on a global stage — their beans fetching record prices and admiration from international roasters.  
    The Third Wave Coffee movement, which values traceability and craftsmanship, perfectly aligns with Rwanda’s dedication to quality and sustainability.  
    At **Jambokawa Coffee**, we proudly source beans from local cooperatives that champion ethical practices, women-led farming, and community empowerment.  
    So the next time you sip your cappuccino or pour-over at our café in Kigali, remember: it’s more than a drink.  
    It’s a story that began a thousand years ago — now reborn in Rwanda’s heart, brewed with passion, patience, and purpose.`

    content: `Simple, elegant, and smooth — the Americano is one of coffee’s most approachable classics.  
    It was born during World War II when American soldiers stationed in Italy found espresso too strong and diluted it with hot water to create a lighter version reminiscent of their home-brewed coffee.  
    The result was a drink that retained espresso’s rich aroma but carried a gentle balance — smooth, mellow, and endlessly drinkable.  
    At **Jambokawa Coffee**, we’ve made the Americano our go-to for those who appreciate purity in every sip.  
    Using Rwandan single-origin espresso, our baristas blend it with precise amounts of hot water to let the beans’ floral sweetness shine.  
    It’s a drink that celebrates minimalism — two ingredients, infinite character.`,
    quote: `The Americano is elegance in simplicity — espresso and water, perfectly balanced in harmony.`,
    content2: `Brewing a great Americano at home is easier than you think.  
    Start with freshly roasted Rwandan beans — we recommend Gakenke or Nyamasheke for their balanced fruit and chocolate notes.  
    Grind finely, extract a double espresso shot, and then slowly add hot water in a 1:2 or 1:3 ratio depending on your strength preference.  
    Want a local twist? Add a hint of Rwandan honey or a sprinkle of cinnamon for warmth.  
    For a refreshing Kigali afternoon, try the **Iced Americano** — served with ice cubes made from brewed coffee to keep it strong to the last drop.  
    Whether you enjoy it in our shop on a breezy terrace overlooking the city or brew it at home, the Americano remains the perfect bridge between strength and serenity — a cup that connects worlds, just like Jambokawa connects tradition and modern taste.`

    content: `Roasting coffee is where magic meets mastery — where green beans from Rwanda’s highlands transform into rich, aromatic perfection.  
    At **Jambokawa**, we believe roasting is both a science and an art form.  
    We start with carefully selected Arabica beans from smallholder farms, then roast them in small batches to unlock their unique flavor stories.  
    During roasting, the beans undergo dramatic changes — from grassy green to golden brown, releasing complex aromas as sugars caramelize and oils emerge.  
    Every crack, every whiff, and every shade matters.`,
    quote: `Roasting is storytelling through heat — each bean whispers its origin through aroma and color.`,
    content2: `Our light roast preserves floral notes — think citrus, jasmine, and sweet honey — perfect for pour-overs or cold brews.  
    Medium roasts highlight chocolate, caramel, and nutty undertones ideal for espresso lovers.  
    Dark roasts? Bold and smoky, perfect for those who want depth and strength.  
    At Jambokawa, we roast daily in Kigali, ensuring your coffee is always fresh — never more than a few days from bean to brew.  
    We invite you to watch our roasting process in person — smell the transformation, hear the first crack, and taste the difference in every cup.  
    Because when coffee is roasted with passion, you don’t just drink it — you experience it.`

    content: `There’s something truly comforting about a perfectly crafted latte — smooth espresso meeting creamy milk in a beautiful swirl of art.  
    At **Jambokawa Coffee**, our baristas spend hours perfecting the texture and temperature to create balance in every cup.  
    The secret? Freshly roasted Rwandan beans, milk steamed to 150°F for velvety microfoam, and a patient hand that pours with rhythm and care.  
    The latte’s beauty lies not just in the design — the heart, the leaf, the tulip — but in its harmony of taste and texture.`,
    quote: `A latte isn’t just a drink; it’s a daily ritual — calm, craft, and creativity in every pour.`,
    content2: `Want to make café-quality lattes at home? Here’s the Jambokawa guide:  
    - Start with **19g of medium-roast Rwandan coffee**.  
    - Extract a 25-second espresso shot.  
    - Steam whole milk until it’s silky and glossy (never bubbling).  
    - Pour slowly, then tilt the cup slightly and finish with a design.  
    Try flavoring with a hint of **Rwandan honey**, **vanilla**, or even **African chai spice** for a local twist.  
    With a bit of practice, your mornings can feel like a Jambokawa coffee moment — right in your own kitchen.`

    content: `Rwanda’s hills are more than just breathtaking — they’re alive with the scent of coffee blossoms and the hum of farmers nurturing world-class beans.  
    Our country’s unique terroir — high altitude, volcanic soil, and gentle equatorial climate — creates conditions found almost nowhere else on Earth.  
    From the shores of Lake Kivu to the slopes of Gakenke, smallholder farmers hand-pick cherries at their peak ripeness, ensuring every cup tells a story of care, heritage, and pride.  
    Rwanda’s coffee industry thrives through cooperatives that emphasize quality and community — empowering thousands of families across the nation.`,

    Taste single-origin brews from regions like Nyamasheke or Huye.

    That’s the spirit of Jambokawa: celebrating Rwanda’s roots, one cup at a time.`
